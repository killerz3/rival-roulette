This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Features

### Support Modal
The app includes a support modal that appears every 4 days to encourage users to support the project. The modal includes:
- **Buy Me a Coffee** button - Links to the Buy Me a Coffee page
- **Remind Me Later** button - Resets the 4-day timer
- **Maybe Later** button - Closes the modal without resetting the timer
- **Click outside to close** - Modal can be dismissed by clicking outside

The modal uses localStorage to track when it was last shown and automatically appears every 4 days to help maintain the website.
